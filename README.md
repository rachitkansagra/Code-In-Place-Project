# Code-In-Place-Project
This is my Code In Place Final Project(Graphical Tic-Tac-Toe)

The Project is based on the Game Of Tic-Tac-Toe, modified by using Images and .csv files.
In the Project, Human player can compete against 2 bots: Random Bot and An AI Bot.

If you want to see how the Game works, watch the following 2-minute Youtube video made by me :

Thank You!!


PS:

tictactoe.py file contains the main code and program of the project.

Files in the folder "coordinates" and "images", and simpleimage.py file are required files for the project 
as they are implemented in the code.
